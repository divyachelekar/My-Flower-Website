    <h1 class="head1">WELCOME TO FLOWER WORLD</h1>
        <iframe width="1019" height="573" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aS-LUW5Jim0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen ></iframe>
        
       

        <section id="f1">
            <h1>Rose</h1>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="Pink_Roses-1024x235.jpg">
    <p class="p1">Like the flower itself, the history of the rose is very colorful. Roses have been naturally growing for over 35 million years! However,<br> they were not known to be cultivated until about 5,000 years ago. Their usage began not just as a decorative touch to one’s home,<br> but they were also used for medicinal purposes, to make perfumes, and their petals were even used as confetti for festive occasions.<br> Getting your roses into water quickly is the first step in caring for them. Fill a vase ¾ full of fresh, cool tap water. The roses will<br> absorb the water, soaking up the nutrients that will travel up to the bloom and create a lively flower. Check the water level in your<br> rose’s vase every day and add more water as needed.</p>
</section>

<section id="f2">
    <h1>Sunflower</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="sunflower_330437881-1024x235.jpeg">
<p class="p1">Sunflowers are one of the most popular flower types and are best known for their dazzling yellow color and large size. Sunflowers<br> generally symbolize adoration, loyalty and longevity in flower language. Native Americans view sunflowers as a symbol of harvest<br> and bounty since the flower provides seeds and pigments on top of being visually beautiful. Sunflowers need direct sunlight for 6 t<br>o 8 hours per day and require hot conditions to flower well. Sunflowers also have long roots that require plenty of room to spread o<br>ut, so soil should be well dug and not too dense for growth. Avoid over fertilization or risk your stems breaking in the fall.</p>
</section>

<section id="f3">
    <h1>Tulips</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="tulip_266902867-1024x235.jpeg">
<p class="p1">There are over 150 species of tulips with over 3,000 different varieties and are part of the lily family. Like most common flowers, t<br>ulips come in a large variety of colors that each have their own meaning. As a signal of the arrival of spring, these blooms are ofte<br>n associated with the Easter holiday. Tulips were at one point more valuable than gold in Holland during a period of “Tulip Mania”<br> and their popularity has only spread with time! Tulip bulbs should be planted in the fall in areas where they can receive partial to full<br> sun. Tulips will fare better in soil that allows for drainage since over watering will drown the bulb and roots.</p>
</section>

<section id="f4">
    <h1>Peonies</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="Peony-162893881-1024x235.jpg">
<p class="p1">From white to red, coral, purple, pink, and yellow, peonies can come in a variety of colors! The key to growing a thriving peony is t<br>o make sure you plant at the proper time, plant correctly, and of course, care for it all throughout the year, even when they aren’t n<br>ecessarily in season. Since peonies can grow rather tall (sometimes even as tall as five feet!), you’ll need to make sure that the sp<br>ot you choose is spacious enough. And remember, peonies can come back year after year, so you’ll need to think long term.</p>
</section>

<section id="f5">
    <h1>Dahlias</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="Dahlia_219226845-1024x235.jpg">
<p class="p1">These bold blooms come in a wide range of color and can be easily incorporated into any existing or new garden. And unlike most<br> plants, these flowers thrive in some shade. They also flower extremely long, first blooming midsummer and lasting through the first <br>frost. However, even though Dahlias are perennials, they are tuberous rooted plants so they should be replanted every spring after <br>resting.</p>
</section>

<section id="f6">
    <h1>Marigold</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="Marigold_319450281-1024x235.jpeg">
<p class="p1">Beautifully orange and gold in color, marigolds are known to symbolize a desire for wealth and to succeed. They are such a bright<br> color that their pigments are also used in the textile and food industry! Marigolds are a versatile flower – they may also be used wh<br>en grieving over the loss of a loved one or when celebrating those who have passed.</p>
</section>

<section id="f7">
    <h1>Aster</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="Aster_255825650-1024x235.jpg">
<p class="p1">Most of these beautiful perennials are native to Eurasia, with only two from North America — the New York and New England asters<br>. Their one-inch flowers are starbursts of closely packed, narrow petals in intense blue, purple, lilac, pink, or white. They brighten a g<br>arden in late summer through fall and are great for attracting butterflies, bees, and other pollinators. The word “aster” means star in<br> Greek, and it sparkles as the September birthday flower. </p>
</section>

<section id="f8">
    <h1>Azalea</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="Azalea_187440753-1024x235.jpg">
<p class="p1">One of the hallmarks of late spring are the vivid azaleas that bloom in yards, along trails, and in woodlands. These familiar shrubs<br> are either evergreen or deciduous and display a profusion of white, pink, red, orange, yellow, or purple flowers that cover the bush<br>es. Azaleas prefer shady locations under trees and thrive in acidic soil. But be careful — all parts of the azalea are poisonous. </p>
</section>

<section id="f9">
    <h1>Black-Eye-Susan</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="Black-Eye-Susan-1024x235.jpg">
<p class="p1">Cheerful black-eyed Susans are one of North America’s favorite perennial wildflowers that are frequently seen in fields and mead<br>ows. They are a popular addition to a sunny garden since they are hardy, they can tolerate drought and a variety of soils, and they<br> can reseed and come back year after year. Black-eyed Susans are perfect for a beginner gardener. Their jolly orange petals and <br>brown centers represent encouragement and can be given to a friend who could use a bouquet of optimism. </p>

<section id="f10">
    <h1>Chrysanthemum</h1>
<img class="img-responsive" src="Chryscenthemum_381443377-1024x235.jpg">
<p class="p1">Cultivated mums originated in China more than 3,000 years ago, and have become familiar and well-loved fall flowers the world o<br>ver. Thousands of varieties with unique flower shapes brighten home gardens, containers, median strips, and parking lots from la<br>te summer through frost with their orange, red, yellow, purple, or white blooms. Chrysanthemums are perennials and will come ba<br>ck year after year if planted early in the season so that they become established and can overwinter. In addition to their beauty, chrysanthemum flowers can be made into a tea, and the leaves can be eaten as salad greens. </p>
